# FAQ: Learning Partner course scheduling on Learn

## Instructor-led training

### What is the Microsoft Learning Partner instructor-led training scheduling service?

Microsoft is releasing a simplified and streamlined learner experience by bringing real time instructor-led training scheduling capabilities to [**Microsoft Learn**](/learn). The course schedule integration on Microsoft Learn will enable learners to preview instructor-led training courses offered by qualified Learning Partners. Once a course is selected, you will be routed directly to the Learning Partner site to complete registration and payment.

This service is currently ‘Public Preview’ and course registration will be available in English only to start. Additional qualifying Learning Partners will be added over the next year.

### Do I need to create a profile to use Microsoft Learn?

No, profile creation is not required. You can still access and consume online learning paths, [browse instructor-led courses](/learn/certifications/courses/browse/), and [find a Microsoft Learning Partner by country or region](/learn/certifications/partners#find-a-microsoft-learning-partner-by-country) without needing to create a profile.

When scheduling an instructor-led training course on Microsoft Learn, you will be redirected to the selected Learning Partner’s site to complete registration and payment. Learning Partners may require you to sign into their site.

### Which features become available to me when I create a Microsoft Learn profile and sign-in?

- Track progress on learning activities 
- Create and share collections of modules 
- Save bookmarks 
- Accrue points and achievements 
- Use free Azure resources 
- View personalized recommendations 

### I registered for a course with a Learning Partner on Microsoft Learn and did not receive a course confirmation. What should I do? 

Please check your inbox, junk mail, or spam looking for an email from the Learning Partner for the course you registered for.  

If still unable to locate your confirmation mail, contact the Learning Partner in which you scheduled the class. The Learning Partner can help troubleshoot any mail issues and/or validate course registration. Learning Partner contact information can be found at: [find a Microsoft Learning Partner by country or region](/learn/certifications/partners#find-a-microsoft-learning-partner-by-country)

### I am registering for a course and I’ve reached the Learning Partner’s site, however there is nothing in the cart.   

Please contact the Learning Provider you selected for the course to resolve the issue. Learning Partner contact information can be found at: [find a Microsoft Learning Partner by country or region](/learn/certifications/partners#find-a-microsoft-learning-partner-by-country)

### I need to cancel or reschedule a course.   

Please contact the Learning Partner directly. Learning Partner contact information can be found at: [find a Microsoft Learning Partner by country or region](/learn/certifications/partners#find-a-microsoft-learning-partner-by-country)

### The price listed on the Learn site was not the same as what was listed at checkout. 

The pricing on the Learning Partner’s site or cart should always be used as the price of the item, even if Learn shows a different amount.  

It is possible that the final price is different on the Learning Partner site or cart as there may be tax included or tax that needs to be calculated during checkout. This may include sales tax and value-added tax (VAT). The final amount you pay may also be affected by the location of the purchaser or the language of the course.  

Some Learning Partners may offer additional service add-ons during the checkout process. The price of those services could change the final price you see at checkout.   

### When will I see courses in my country or region?  

This is a new service that has been released in ‘Public Preview’ with a small number of qualified Learning Partners to test functionality and fine tune the process. Initially, course scheduling will be English with additional Learning Partners added over the following 12 months.

### How come other training courses are more or less expensive than the one I want to attend?

As with any marketplace, the price of the class is determined by each Learning Partner. Partners are required to provide a full Microsoft Official Course training experience for the price that is listed on the Microsoft Learn scheduling tool. Partners are permitted to advertise additional products and services that are optional. If you feel that advertised pricing is misleading or inaccurate, please contact us at the [Learning Partner instructor-led course scheduling on Learn support forum](https://trainingsupport.microsoft.com/en-us/iltvilt/forum).

### Filtering by course location, date, etc. is not working properly.

If filtering is not working, please refresh your browser and try again. If you feel filters are still not working, you can ask your question in the [Learning Partner instructor-led course scheduling on Learn support forum](https://trainingsupport.microsoft.com/en-us/iltvilt/forum). It is the best resource to search and ask for help, report a problem, and get advice.

### I am unable to find the Learning Partner in my area.

If you do not see the Learning Partner or course you are looking for, you may find additional days and times directly on a Learning Partner site beyond what is displayed on Microsoft Learn.  Learning Partners are not required to list schedules for all their classes. You can find a list of all Microsoft Learning Partners at [find a Microsoft Learning Partner by country or region](/learn/certifications/partners#find-a-microsoft-learning-partner-by-country).

As we launch this new service, we are limiting the number of qualified Learning Partners. Over the next year, Learning Partners that meet specific criteria will be added.

### I’ve gone through the Learning Partner’s support channel and I’ve not received any response.

The Learning Partner is responsible for providing support related to scheduling on their site. You can try different numbers for the Learning Partner by looking at their website.

If you are still unable to reach the Learning Partner, you may post your question on the [Learning Partner instructor-led course scheduling on Learn support forum](https://trainingsupport.microsoft.com/en-us/iltvilt/forum). It is the best resource to ask for help, report a problem, and get advice.
