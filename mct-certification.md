# Become a Microsoft Certified Trainer

Microsoft Certified Trainers (MCTs) are the premier technical and instructional experts in Microsoft technologies. Join this exclusive group of worldwide Microsoft technical training professionals and reap the benefits of MCT training certification and membership.

You will get exclusive benefits as an MCT including access to the complete library of official Microsoft training and certification products, substantial discounts on exams, books, and Microsoft products. In addition, you will be able to use Microsoft readiness resources to help you enhance your training career and engage with other MCT members in an online community forum. You will also receive invitations to exclusive Microsoft and local MCT community events.

As a Microsoft Certified Trainer, you need to earn a Microsoft Certification validating your experience and knowledge in using Microsoft products and solutions for each course you deliver.

The Microsoft Certified Trainer program is an annual membership program. You must meet program requirements, complete an online application, and pay an annual fee to renew your training certification for the coming year.

Contact [MCT Support](https://aka.ms/mctforum) if you have questions about the MCT program requirements, the MCT enrollment or renewal process, or for any other questions about the MCT program.
