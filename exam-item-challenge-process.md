# Exam item challenge process

Microsoft certification exams are designed to ensure that candidates who pass exams and earn our certifications have demonstrated the required proficiency level(s) across the skill domain(s). Each Microsoft Certification exam question is carefully reviewed by a panel of technical and job-function experts for technical accuracy, clarity, and relevance. If you believe that a question on a Microsoft Certification exam is inaccurate, you may request an evaluation of the question via the exam item challenge process, designed to help identify and correct problematic questions. However, even if a question is flawed in some way we cannot assume that you would have answered it correctly if it had not been, therefore most exams are not rescored. In these cases, we provide learners with the opportunity to retake the exam free of charge.

### Criteria for accepting an Exam Item Challenge:

- Exam must have been taken within the last 30 calendar days (not business days).
- Requests for score reviews.
- Challenge on a specific item on the exam.

### Exam Item Challenges will not be accepted for the following criteria:
