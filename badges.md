# Microsoft Exam and Certification Badges

Let the world know about your achievement as soon as you pass an exam or earn a certification with a digital badge!

Digital badges allow you to easily share your skills in a way that is trusted and verifiable.

Your Microsoft badge empowers you to:

- Easily share your certifications and exams with your professional network.
- Learn which employers are looking for individuals with your skills.
- Discover the salary you can expect in jobs that require your Microsoft skills.
- Search for new job opportunities associated with your certification and apply in just a few clicks.

For more details, see our blog post [Unlock Active Job Postings with Your Microsoft Certification](/learn/certifications/posts/unlock-active-job-postings-with-your-microsoft-certification).

## What is a digital badge?

Microsoft has partnered with Credly’s Acclaim platform to award badges for your certification achievements.

Badges are digital representations of your achievements, consisting of an image and metadata uniquely linked to you. When someone views your badge, they can learn more about your skills and verify the badge’s authenticity—ensuring only you can take credit for your skills.

In addition, the look and feel of our badges more closely align with the other credentials you might earn from Microsoft. Now, when you share your digital badge on popular online sites, such as LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter, or when you embed it into your résumé, personal website, or email signature, anyone who views your badge will immediately recognize it as issued by Microsoft.

## What is the process for claiming a badge?

Claiming your Microsoft badge is simple. After you’ve earned a certification or passed an exam, you’ll receive a notification email from Microsoft. To claim your first badge:  

1. Click the link in that email.
2. Create an account on Credly’s Acclaim platform.
3. Confirm your account by clicking the link in a confirmation email that is generated after you set up your account.

Claiming future badges is as easy as clicking the link in the notification email and logging into our Acclaim account.

Want to simplify that process?

Simply adjust your account settings to automatically accept badges issued to you. You can watch the step-by-step process in the video [Acclaim How To: Manage your badge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMeSQM0h1_Y). Note that while the video shows badge email notifications coming from Acclaim, your email notifications will come from Microsoft.

Don’t forget to take advantage of the features offered on Credly’s Acclaim platform:

- Share your badge on LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter.
- Download your badge image and URL to embed in a résumé, website, or email signature.
- Personalize your profile on the Acclaim platform.
- Explore labor market insights and job opportunities. Watch the video [Acclaim How To: Explore labor market insights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4qBl17VgBo) to see how easy it is to quickly discover opportunities in your market.

Your digital badge is one more way that Microsoft supports the development and recognition of your professional skills. Take advantage of this program to accelerate your career growth.

## Do you have unclaimed badges?

You can claim your badge at any time, even if you passed an exam or achieved a certification in the past. All badges that you have earned from Microsoft based on your past certification history are available through the Acclaim platform. Simply log into your account and claim them!

If you don’t have an Acclaim account, you can create an account on the [Acclaim](https://www.youracclaim.com/)* platform site using the same email address that Microsoft has on file for you. Your badge will be waiting in your account for you to claim.

## Am I eligible for a badge?

We issue badges for all active exams and certifications in the Microsoft Certification program with the following exceptions:  

- In cases where passing one exam results in a certification, a badge is issued for the certification rather than the exam.
- Exam 74-343 Managing Projects with Microsoft Project (retired July 2019).
- MOS 2010 Exams and Certifications.
- Microsoft Dynamics CRM Exams (MB2-706, MB2-707, MB2-708, MB2-710, MB2-711, MB2-712, MB2-713, MB2-714 (all retired December 31, 2019)).
- Legacy exams and certifications. Badges are not available for some of our legacy exams and certifications. If you do not see a badge for a legacy exam or certification in your Acclaim profile, we did not issue one for that exam or certification.

If you earned a badge for an exam or certification that has been retired, you can still claim your badge via Credly’s Acclaim platform and share it to other platforms or by email. See the answer to “Do you have unclaimed badges?” in FAQs to learn how.
