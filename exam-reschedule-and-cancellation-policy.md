# Exam reschedule and cancellation policy

<div><font color='red'>Microsoft will be temporarily waiving the reschedule and cancellation fee as long as you cancel your exams within 24 hours prior to your scheduled appointment.</font></div>

- There is no charge if you reschedule or cancel an exam appointment at least 6 business days prior to your appointment.
- If you cancel or reschedule your exam within 5 business days of your registered exam time, a fee will be applied.
- If you fail to show up for your exam appointment or you donâ€™t reschedule or cancel your appointment at least 24 hours prior to your scheduled appointment, you forfeit your entire exam fee. Business days are Monday-Friday, not including global holidays.

Rescheduling or cancelling your scheduled exam appointment can be done through the [Certification Dashboard](https://aka.ms/certdashboard).
