## Offer details

The free exam offer is available for redemption from the beginning of the event which you are attending and is valid until January 31, 2021.

## FAQ

### About the offer

**Q: How many exams can I schedule for free with this offer?**

**A:** You can claim one free eligible certification exam with this offer. The offer is one free eligible exam, even if you attend multiple Microsoft Ignite events.

**Q: What certification exams are eligible for this offer?**

**A:** This offer includes all Microsoft fundamentals, role-based, and specialty certification exams. For a list of eligible certification exams, see "Eligible exams for this offer" section on our offer details page: [https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/certifications/microsoft-ignite-free-certification-exam-offer#eligible-exams-for-this-offer](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/certifications/microsoft-ignite-free-certification-exam-offer#eligible-exams-for-this-offer).

**Q: If I registered for an eligible event but did not attend in person, can I still claim this offer?**

**A:** No, this offer is only applicable to those who have attended Microsoft Ignite 2019 or a Microsoft Ignite The Tour 2019-2020 event in person.

**Q: If I registered for an eligible event but the event was cancelled, can I still claim this offer?**

**A:** No. The certification exam offer is an extension of the on-site experience and if the event is cancelled, the certification exam offer is unavailable. However, we encourage you to continue learning with free, interactive training on [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/)!

**Q: Why do the terms and conditions of this offer state residents of Israel, Germany, or Sweden are ineligible?**

**A:** Residents of these territories are ineligible for this offer due to Microsoft's gifting policy and local laws. Each of these countries have specific laws that limit what any company can gift its residents, and the value of our certification exams exceed limits and therefore, Microsoft is unable to offer residents of these countries a free exam.

### Scheduling your free exam

**Q: Do I need to schedule my free exam from this offer _during_ the event I've attended or plan to attend?**

**A:** No, you do not need to schedule your free exam from this offer during the event which you've attended. You can schedule the exam during the event or after the event; the offer to take a free exam expires on January 31, 2021.

**Q: When verifying my exam discount eligibility, I run into an error stating I'm ineligible because I'm a government official but I'm not. What should I do?**

**A:** If you've been incorrectly identified as a government official, you will need to update the government field in your event registration profile and wait until the event is over to see eligibility. You may also contact the [Microsoft Certification Support Forum](https://trainingsupport.microsoft.com/mcp/forum?sort=LastReplyDate&dir=Desc&tab=All&status=all&mod=&modAge=&advFil=&postedAfter=&postedBefore=&threadType=All&isFilterExpanded=false&page=1) ([https://aka.ms/CertificationSupport](https://aka.ms/CertificationSupport)) for assistance.
