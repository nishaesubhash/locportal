summary: |-
  In this workshop, you will learn to design a data pipeline solution that leverages Cosmos DB for both the scalable ingest of streaming data, and the globally distributed serving of both pre-scored data and machine learning models. The solution leverages the Cosmos DB change data feed in concert with the Azure Databricks Delta to enable a modern data warehouse solution that can be used to create risk reduction solutions for scoring transactions for fraud in an offline, batch approach and in a near real-time, request/response approach.
