summary: |-
  In this workshop, you gain a better understanding of how to conduct a site analysis for a customer to compare cost, performance, and level of effort required to migrate from Oracle to SQL Server or PostgreSQL. There are two migration paths included in this workshop and the training files are named appropriately for each path. Both workshops share a common customer Oracle migration scenario. Each workshop path has tailored database platform migration steps to assist you in this learning journey. You will evaluate the dependent applications and reports that need to be updated and come up with a migration plan. Also, you will design and build a proof of concept (POC) to help the customer take advantage of new SQL Server or PostgreSQL features to improve performance and resiliency.
  
  For those students focusing on the SQL Server migration, you will explore ways to migrate from an old version of SQL Server to the latest version and consider the impact of migrating from on-premises to the cloud.
