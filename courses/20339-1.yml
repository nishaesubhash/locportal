summary: |-
  This five-day course will provide you with the knowledge and
  skills to plan and administer a Microsoft SharePoint 2016 environment. The
  course teaches you how to deploy, administer, and troubleshoot your SharePoint
  environment. This course also provides guidelines, best practices, and
  considerations that help you optimize your SharePoint deployment.

  This is the first in a
  sequence of two courses for IT professionals and is aligned with the SharePoint
  2016 IT Pro certification.

  #### Audience profile
  The course is
  targeted at experienced IT professionals who are interested in learning how to
  install, configure, deploy, and manage SharePoint 2016 installations either in
  a data center or in the cloud. Students typically have more than one year of hands-on experience* with planning and maintaining
  SharePoint and two years’ experience with other core technologies on which
  SharePoint depends, including Windows Server 2012 R2 or later, Internet
  Information Services (IIS), Microsoft SQL Server 2014 or later, Active
  Directory Domain Services (AD DS), and networking infrastructure services.  
  The minimally qualified candidate typically&#58;
  Is an IT professional who plans, implements,
  and maintains a multi-server deployment of SharePoint 2016; Has a working knowledge of, and preferably
  hands-on experience, with SharePoint Online; Has broad familiarity with SharePoint
  workloads; Has experience with business continuity
  management, including data backup, restoration, and high availability; Has experience with authentication and
  security technologies; Has experience with Windows PowerShell.
  * The hands-on experience or job experience should
  be from a solutions-based role where the candidate has worked on multiple solutions
  in the SharePoint space that includes document management, content management,
  and search.
prerequisitesSection: |-
  Before attending this course,
  students must have knowledge of&#58;
  - Software management in a Windows Server 2012 or Windows Server 2012 R2 enterprise server environment.
  - Deploying and managing applications natively, virtually, and in the cloud.
  - Administering IIS.
  - Configuring AD DS for use in authentication, authorization, and as a user store.
  - Managing an application remotely by using Windows PowerShell 4.0.

  An ideal candidate for this course must have at least one year of experience
  with deploying and administering multiple SharePoint 2013 farms across a large
  enterprise. Because many customers have not upgraded from SharePoint 2010, a candidate
  can also have at least two years of experience with SharePoint 2010. However,
  they also must understand the differences between SharePoint 2010 and
  SharePoint 2013, particularly in terms of hybridization.
