  ### Module 1&#58; Deploying Windows 10 using the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit
  The exercises in this lab focus on deploying Windows 10 by using MDT to a new computer and refreshing the operating system on an existing device running Windows 7 to Windows 10 by using Lite Touch Installation (LTI). The big takeaway from the exercises in this lab is that you can deploy Windows 10 by using highly automated processes that help minimize the use of IT resources, reduce configuration errors, reduce complexity, and reduce the overall effort required to deploy Windows 10 and apps.

  #### Lab &#58; Deploying Windows 10 to a new computer (or “bare metal” deployment)

  #### Lab &#58; Deploying Windows 10 to an existing device running Windows 7
  After completing this module, you will be able to&#58;
  - Understand how to deploy Windows 10 to a new computer using MDT
  - Understand how to refresh a computer running Windows 7 to Windows 10


  ### Module 2&#58; Windows 10 across the  Desktop, Tablets, and Phones
  Windows 10 is designed for use with many different devices. Desktops, tablets, phones, Xbox 1, and embedded devices like the Raspberry Pi. This session gives you the overview you need to understand what Windows 10 brings to mobile devices. The videos demonstrate the user experience on multiple devices, while the hands-on lab offers the student access to using the new universal apps and the Windows 10 user interface.

  #### Lab &#58; Exploring the new User Interface (UI) of Windows 10
  After completing this lab, you will be able to&#58;
  - Know the features of the key pieces of the new Windows 10 UI
  - Use the new Start Screen and Menu
  - How to configure and use Cortana
  - Use Action Center functionality
  - Use IE 11 and the new Microsoft Edge 
  - Configure and use the new mail and calendar universal app

  ### Module 3&#58; Staying Current with Windows 10
  The videos for this module discussed how System Center Configuration Manager (CM), Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), as well as Mobile Device Management tools like Microsoft Intune can all be used to keep your Windows 10 systems up to date. The exercises in this unit's labs show how to deploy Windows 10 by using System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager Technical Preview. In the first exercise, you will see how to deploy Windows 10 to a new computer. In the second exercise, you will see how to deploy Windows 10 to a device running Windows 8.1, while retaining the user settings and data. Updates and patches would be deployed in a similar manner using CM for Windows 10 systems. Finally, in Exercise 3 you will create a Provisioning Package using the new Windows Imaging and Configuration Designer (ICD) tool. ICD is used to customize Windows 10 images and is included in the free Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK) for Windows 10. A provisioning package can include policies, and management instructions, installation of specific apps, customization of network connections, and more.

  ### Module 4&#58; A New Era of Threat Resistance for the Windows 10 Platform
  Windows 10 protects you from modern security treats and we’ve organized our efforts around the following pillars including secure device/hardware, secure identities, information protection and threat resistance.

  Microsoft Device Guard, is an umbrella term that covers the integration of security features of Windows 10. Some of these features were introduced in earlier versions of Windows, and some are new to this release. These features take advantage of new virtualization-based security (VBS) options and the trust-nothing mobile device operating system model. This makes Windows 10 defenses much more difficult for malware to penetrate.
