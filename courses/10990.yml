  - Publish a report to reporting services.


  ### Module 4&#58; Working with Reporting Services Data
  It is common for business requirements to change regarding the information they need and how they want data presented. On viewing a detailed report, senior management might ask for higher level, summarized, or filtered versions of the same report.

  Report Builder and Report Designer support these scenarios via filtering, sorting, drilldowns, grouping and the parameterizing of reports.

  In this module, you will see how to use filters and parameters to make reports more dynamic and useful to business users.


  #### Lessons
  - Data filters
  - Report parameters
  - Implementing report filters and parameters


  #### Lab &#58; Create a parameterized report
  - Using parameters in report designer
  - Using parameters in report builder

  After completing this module, students will be able to&#58;
  - Filter data in reports
  - Use parameters in reports


  ### Module 5&#58; Visualizing Data with Report Services
  As the amount of data being generated continues to grow, the need to make sense of its meaning increases. You use data visualization to make data easier to understand, and faster to interpret.

  Data visualizations highlight comparisons, show trends, and convey scale much faster than a table of numbers could. The detail is important, but visualizations are a highly effective way of conveying meaning and insights quickly and accurately.


  #### Lessons
  - Formatting data
  - Images and charts
  - Databars, sparklines, indicators, gauges, and maps


  #### Lab &#58; Manage formatting
  - Report designer
  - Report builder

  After completing this module, you will be able to&#58;
  - Format data in reports.
  - Use images and charts in your reports.
  - Use databars, sparklines, and indicators in reports.
  - Explain what a KPI is and how it’s used.


  ### Module 6&#58; Summarizing Report Data
  As the amount of data we need to deal with increases, so does the requirement to manage data by grouping and summarizing. In this module, you will learn how to create group structures, summarize data, and provide interactivity in your reports, so that users see the level of detail or summary that they need.
  #### Lessons
  - Sorting and grouping
  - Report sub-reports
  - Drilldown and drill through


  #### Lab &#58; Summarizing report data
  - Sorting and grouping in report builder
  - Sorting and grouping in report designer

  After completing this module, students will be able to&#58;
  - Group and sort data in reports.
  - Create report sub-sections.
  - Use drill down and drill through.


  ### Module 7&#58; Sharing Reporting Services Reports
  When you have published a Reporting Services report, users can view the report interactively. In some situations, it can be advantageous to run reports automatically, either to improve performance through caching and snapshots, or to deliver reports to users—by using e-mail or other mechanisms. To run reports automatically, you need to understand how Reporting Services manages scheduling.
  This module covers report scheduling, caching and the report life cycle, and automatic subscription and delivery of reports.

  #### Lessons
  - Schedules
  - Report caching, snapshots, and comments
  - Report subscription and delivery


  #### Lab &#58; Sharing reporting services reports
  - Create a shared schedule
  - Configure caching
  - Subscribe to a report

  After completing this module, students will be able to&#58;
  - Explain schedules.
  - Describe report caching, report snapshots, and report comments.
  - Configure report subscriptions.


  ### Module 8&#58; Administering Reporting Services
  System administrators take responsibility for the configuration and day-to-day operations of IT systems. In SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS), administrative tasks include the configuration of the web portal and web service, branding the web portal, and ensuring that access to sensitive reports is carefully controlled. Administrators also monitor and optimize performance.
  #### Lessons
  - Administering reporting services
  - Reporting services configuration
  - Reporting services performance


  #### Lab &#58; Administering reporting services

  - Use report services configuration manager to reconfigure SSRS servers.
  - Monitor and optimize the performance of SSRS on a given set of server hardware.


  ### Module 9&#58; Extending and Integrating Reporting Services
  Although Reporting Services is a powerful tool, its built-in capabilities might not always meet your needs. This module covers the methods for extending the functionality of Reporting Services with expressions and custom code. You will also learn about the methods for working with Reporting Services programmatically, and integrating Reporting Services reports into other applications.


  #### Lessons
  - Expressions and embedded code
  - Extending reporting services
  - Integrating reporting services
