summary: |-
  In this workshop, you will learn how to evaluate Microsoft's catalog of PaaS and SaaS-based IoT products to determine the optimal combination of tools to fulfill Fabrikam's needs. You will design and implement a solution that simplifies IoT device management and reporting, providing Fabrikam with a faster path to realizing their IoT strategy without requiring a lot of custom development. Next, you will learn how to deploy a trained predictive maintenance Machine Learning model and design a stream processing pipeline that makes predictions with the model in near real-time. At the end of this pipeline is an alert that is sent to the oil pump maintenance team when a pump failure is imminent.
