summary: |-
  In this workshop, you will learn how to design a hybrid cloud architecture using a combination of the Azure public cloud and Azure Stack. This functional architecture will enable customers to leverage their investments in Azure as a "cloud platform," rather than Azure as a "place." You will learn to determine which systems are good candidates for the Azure public cloud and which are better suited on Azure Stack.
