  ### Module 1&#58; Introduction to Self-Service BI Solutions
  Business intelligence (BI) is a term that has become increasingly common over recent years. Along with big data, data mining, predictive analytics, data science, and data stewards, BI is now very much part of business vocabulary. Much of the impetus behind this is the need for organizations to cope with ever-increasing datasets. It is now normal to have databases that contain millions of rows, requiring gigabytes, terabytes, or even petabytes, of storage space. Data is no longer confined to an on-premises server room—it is hosted in the cloud, feeds are taken from third-party providers, public datasets are freely available, and social media interactions generate ever-expanding datasets.

  Reporting and analysis is certainly not a new concept to business, but the difference between how data analysis is done today, compared with five or 10 years ago, is immense. Nowadays, organizations need BI to see not only what was done in the past, but also more of what is to come. There is now an overwhelming amount of data to gather and compose into reports. There is also an increasing need for data to offer up-to-the-minute numbers, so business can react faster to changing trends in markets and industries. Those businesses that can react fast and predict near-term trends to provide products and services where there is consumer demand have the best chance of survival in our modern and highly competitive world. With the rise of big data, there is an increasing need for data analysts who can take this data, and find the critical points within a plethora of information.

  ### Module 2&#58; Introducing Power BI
  Self-Service Business Intelligence (BI) has rapidly grown in popularity because of its ability to empower users to generate reports, process data, perform analysis, and more—all without having to depend on a report developer. The Self-Service BI trend is driven by Microsoft's commitment to improving Excel and Power BI, both products having seen many enhancements over recent years. However, despite Microsoft enabling deeper data analysis with the four power tools added to Excel—Power Pivot, Power View, Power Query, and Power Map—they are not fully integrated into the Excel interface. Instead, they exist in separate windows. Add to this the complexity of publishing to SharePoint to share reports with colleagues, and it all becomes a time-consuming effort.

  Using Power BI eliminates complications and barriers with a simple integrated user interface, and has the ability to publish rapidly to either a cloud-based or an on-premise portal to share reports easily. This module introduces Power BI, and explores the features that enable the rapid creation and publication of sophisticated data visualizations.

  ### Module 3&#58; Power BI Data
  Power BI offers a straightforward approach to report creation, and the ability to create and share dashboards without dependency on a report developer, or the need for Microsoft SharePoint. Microsoft Excel has long been the tool of choice for data analysts who work in a self-service style. However, Excel does not offer a quick and easy way to share reports without the use of either SharePoint, or the creation of multiple copies of spreadsheets that quickly become out of date, or exist outside source control.

  In recent years, power tools have been added to Excel&#58; Power View, Power Query (known as Get & Transform in Excel 2016), and Power Pivot. Power BI brings much of this power into an integrated environment in the form of Power BI Desktop. Previously, Excel users have been inconvenienced by needing to transition between the different power tools, but Power BI Desktop brings the tools together. This means that Power BI is fast becoming an obvious choice for the analysis and sharing of data. However, analysts are likely to continue working with Excel for the foreseeable future. Power BI easily cooperates with Excel, and many other data sources. It’s this ability to create reports rapidly, by using data from a combination of sources, that really puts the power into Power BI.
  #### Lessons
  - Using Excel as a Data Source for Power BI
  - The Power BI Data Model
  - Using Databases as a Data Source for Power BI
  - The Power BI Service


  #### Lab &#58; Importing Data into Power BI

  - Take advantage of the features of the Power BI service.
  - Use Q&A to ask questions in natural query language and create apps.


  ### Module 4&#58; Shaping and Combining Data
  Power BI Desktop offers a self-service solution for creating visual, interactive reports and dashboards. Users can connect to a wide variety of data sources, combining data from on-premises databases, Software as a Solution (SaaS) providers, cloud-based services, and local files such as Microsoft Excel, into one report. The beauty of Power BI reports and dashboards is the ability to rapidly build reports to present this data so it is instantly readable—with clusters, outliers, and patterns in data visually brought to light. To achieve this, each report must have a dataset comprising tables and columns that are ready to add straight into visualizations. Data must be formatted for relevant currencies, numbers should have correct decimal places, additional columns and measures might be required, and data may have to be combined from multiple tables. With Power BI Desktop, you can do all of this, with powerful, built-in tools for shaping your data. This module introduces the tools that are available for preparing your data, and transforming it into a form ready for reporting.
