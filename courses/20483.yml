summary: |-
  This training course teaches developers the programming skills that are required for developers to create Windows applications using the Visual C# language. During their five days in the classroom students review the basics of Visual C# program structure, language syntax, and implementation details, and then consolidate their knowledge throughout the week as they build an application that incorporates several features of the .NET Framework 4.7.

  #### Audience profile

  ### Module 1&#58; Review of Visual C# Syntax
  The Microsoft .NET Framework version 4.7 provides a comprehensive development platform that you can use to build, deploy, and manage applications and services.

  ### Module 2&#58; Creating Methods, Handling Exceptions, and Monitoring Applications
  Applications often consist of logical units of functionality that perform specific functions, such as providing access to data or triggering some logical processing. Visual C# is an object-orientated language and uses the concept of methods to encapsulate logical units of functionality. A method can be as simple or as complex as you like, and therefore it is important to consider what happens to the state of your application when an exception occurs in a method.
