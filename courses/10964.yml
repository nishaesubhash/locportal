  ### Module 5&#58; Application Performance Monitoring
  Most organizations utilize the Microsoft .NET Framework to build custom applications such as for intranet web sites. As there will not be an available Management Pack for these custom applications you should understand how Application Performance Monitoring (APM) is configured in Operations Manager. APM provides extensive monitoring for .NET and Java based applications that include both Server and Client side monitoring. 
  
  In addition to monitoring .NET applications directly through Operations Manager it is important that you understand how APM can be used with the full functionality of Visual Studio IntelliTrace Collector for gathering full application profiling traces. With System Center 2012 you can also integrate Operations Manager with Team Foundation Server. It is important that you understand how this integration is configured so that Operations Manager can be used to synchronize alerts with work items in Team Foundation Server.
  #### Lessons
  - Application Performance Monitoring
  - Using IntelliTrace
  - Team Foundation Server Integration


  #### Lab &#58; Monitoring .NET Framework Applications

  - Configure Application Performance Monitoring.
  - Configure IntelliTrace with APM to debug .NET applications.
  - Integrate Operations Manager with Team Foundation Server.


  ### Module 6&#58; End to End Service Monitoring
  When monitoring key line of business applications, monitoring should be performed from both a data center perspective and an end-user perspective. In this module you will learn how you can create synthetic transactions to measure end-user performance. 
  
  You will also learn how to combine component monitoring with synthetic transactions in distributed application models that describe the relationship between the various components of an application. This provides a single view for identifying route cause and impact of any potential service outage.
  
  Finally you will learn how to build rich Visio dashboards to show real-time health to external users.
  #### Lessons

  ### Module 7&#58; Scorecards, Dashboards and Reporting
  Visualizing service and application health in Operations Manager is a key feature that enables at-a-glance views to be quickly and easily created.  These views (or dashboards) can instantly display performance and availability for one or more applications in a single pane.
  
  It is important that you understand how to create scorecards and dashboards in order to provide different types of users within the business with a view into how the monitored environment is performing. For example a Service Owner may just require a high-level view showing whether or not end users are able to access a service whereby an executive may just require a view showing whether a service is in or out of SLA.
  
  Reporting is also important in understanding how the monitored environment is performing. Certain personnel may not have access to the Operations Console or receive alerts by email, but they may still require access to important information about the health and performance of key applications and services. In this scenario, reports can be used to provide an interface into collected Operations Manager data.
  
  Service and application owners must also know that services supplied to the business are meeting service level agreements for performance and availability. Therefore, you must know how Service Level Tracking is configured and displayed in Operations Manager.
  #### Lessons
  - Configuring and Managing Reporting in Operations Manager
  - Configuring Service Level Tracking
  - Configuring the Operations Manager SharePoint WebPart
  - Configuring Dashboards and Widgets
  - Creating Custom Dashboards

  ### Module 8&#58; Configuring and Customizing the Console
  Application support teams that use Operations Manager can do so either via a locally installed console or through the Web Console. Typically within an application support team there are a number of roles that require different levels of permissions when using the Operations Console. These range from read-only users through to advanced operators. Further to this, all of these roles must be limited to only display data about the computers and applications that the operators are responsible for. In this module you will learn how to use the inbuilt role-based security within Operations Manager to provide granular access to data, views and tasks in Operations Manager.
  
  Application support teams typically require customized views within the console for their key applications. You will also learn how to design and provision these views to relevant support teams.
  
  Whilst some team members may always have the console open, other teams may require a notification to be sent when an issue is detected. Operations manager uses Notifications and Notification Channels to achieve this functionality. This module describes how to configure these and send email alerts to key teams.
  
  Finally, in order to reduce workload on the various application support teams you will learn how to configure Diagnostic and Recovery tasks in Operations Manager. This will provide a method of diagnosing and automating the remediation of issues that have been detected.
  #### Lessons
  - Security, Scoping and User Roles
  - Creating Custom Views and Alert Resolution States
  - Configuring Notification Subscriptions

  ### Module 9&#58; Management Pack Authoring
  For common applications such as Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft Exchange Server there is already a fully developed Management Pack available. You can extend the default monitoring contained in Operations Manager by creating rules, monitors and groups within the Operators console. 
  
  However it may be necessary to author a completely new management pack to monitor custom applications. To achieve this you would author the management pack in Visual studio, seal the management pack and the deploy it. The management pack should then automatically discover and monitor the components of the application.
  
  Management Pack authoring is a detailed topic that requires a base understanding of the core concepts before proceeding. This module will cover these topics including how you create a Management Pack in both the console and Visual Studio.
  #### Lessons
