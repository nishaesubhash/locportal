# Student discounts

## Certification for students

Academic pricing on Microsoft Certified Professional exams is available in most countries (except India and China).

You must verify your student status before scheduling your exam in order to be eligible for academic pricing.

## Applying student status through your account profile

1. Sign in with your Microsoft account credentials.
2. Select **Profile settings** from the **Account** menu at the top of the page.
3. In the **Job function** menu, select, or ensure that you have selected, “Student.”
4. Look for the academic pricing notice that appears next to the **Job function** menu. If your student status has not yet been validated, click “Get verified” to verify your status.

## Applying student status when registering for an exam

1. Sign in with your Microsoft account credentials.
2. On the exam for which you want to register, click **Schedule exam**.
