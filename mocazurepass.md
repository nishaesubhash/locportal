# Access to Microsoft Learning Azure Passes for Students of Authorized Microsoft Learning Partners

<div>Below is information regarding Azure Passes which Microsoft provides to support lab solutions for specific courses covering Microsoft cloud technologies.

Last Updated: **August 06, 2020**

Microsoft is offering your students access to a free 30-day Microsoft Azure Pass when they register for an eligible Azure-related course using Microsoft Official Courses. Passes for students can only be obtained by the authorized Microsoft Learning Partner through Courseware Marketplace, and is directly tied to a MOC course purchase, with a limit of one pass per MOC course ordered. No other mechanism for obtaining passes for students will be available. If a Learning Partner orders a MOC course but does not select the Azure Pass that is available with the course at the time of purchase, the Partner will have the option to return to Courseware Marketplace and subsequently order that Pass if needed.

Partners, please reference the Terms and Conditions for Azure Passes distributed through Courseware Marketplace [here](https://shop.courseware-marketplace.com/shop/en-GB/Content/TermsAndConditions). Passes will be valid for 90 days from being allocated to you on the Courseware Marketplace. Expired passes cannot be reissued

MCTs are permitted to request one pass for their eligible Azure course preparation needs. This continues to be the case and MCTs can request their eligible Azure course preparation pass [here](https://vouchers.cloudapp.net/AzurePass/), however this offering may be terminated at any time.

There are a limited number of passes available to be distributed to Learning Partners and MCTs. Availability can only be guaranteed while supplies last and only in [countries](https://www.windowsazure.com/pricing/faq/) where Microsoft Azure is supported.
