# Beta exams


Approximately 400 people can take the beta exam at a reduced rate. To take advantage of this reduced rate, you need a beta code that must be entered as part of your payment during registration. To obtain this code, you can:

1. Join our SME Profile database. Members whose skills align to the exam content area will receive an email containing this code; this code is unique for this group. If you are a member of our SME database, early access to the beta requires that you keep your profile up to date as we target distribution of these codes to those who have skills related to the new exam. (The SME Profile database program is hosted on [Microsoft Collaborate](https://aka.ms/collaborate). See the blog post [Help Us Create Exams and Learning Content!](/learn/certifications/posts/help-us-create-exams-and-learning-content) Join our SME Database Today!)
2. Watch the announcements on the [Microsoft Learn Blog](https://aka.ms/learningblog) for information about upcoming beta exams. These posts will contain a code that can be used to receive a discount on the exam. These posts are usually posted on the day that registration opens for a beta exam. This code is different than the one sent to SMEs who are part of our database.

Note that seats are limited and available on a first come, first served basis, and that beta exams are not delivered in China, India, Pakistan, or Turkey for security reasons.

Candidates who take the beta exam using the 80% discount code will receive a 25% discount voucher from the exam delivery provider approximately 6 weeks after the exam goes live. These vouchers are provided by the exam delivery provider and are sent to the email address that you used when you registered for the exam. If you do not receive your 25% discount voucher within 6 weeks of the exam live date, please contact the exam delivery provider’s Customer Support. _This discount is NOT generally available to all beta participants. If you pay for the beta exam using any other method, you are not eligible for the 25% discount voucher._

Please note: When you complete a beta exam, you do not receive a score immediately because the scoring model for the exam is not yet finalized. <strong>You usually receive your exam score within 2-3 weeks after the exam becomes available worldwide—this can be up to 16 weeks after you take the exam</strong>, depending on when in the beta period you took the exam. This time frame reflects the comprehensive process used to evaluate the beta exam results, including statistically analyzing the data to evaluate the performance of each question and reading and evaluating all comments provided during the beta exam.</em></font></div>

<div><font color='red'><em>The rescore process starts on the day that exams go live, and final scores are released approximately 10 days later. However, once the result is announced learner will receive the mail stating the result.</em></font></div>
