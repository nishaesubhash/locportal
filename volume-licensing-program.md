The following questions specifically address Volume Licensing for Microsoft training and certification solutions. Visit the [certification overview](/learn/certifications/) or [exam policies and FAQ](/learn/certifications/certification-exam-policies) pages for answers to general questions regarding Microsoft Certification or the exams.

### **Microsoft training and certification solutions**

**Q: What products are supported by Microsoft training and certification solutions?**

Microsoft training and certification solutions support Microsoft solution areas, including:

- Apps and Infrastructure
- Data and AI
- Modern Work
- Business Applications

As Microsoft adds or changes solutions areas, our certification program will be updated to reflect those priorities.

**Q: In what regions can I purchase training and certification products through my Volume Licensing agreement?**

Microsoft training and certification solutions are available within Volume Licensing in all regions. Contact your Volume Licensing account manager with any questions about pricing, licensing, and accelerated discounting.

### **Product access and usage**

**Q: If I acquire a Microsoft training and certification solutions license, how do I access the content?**

You can access content for Microsoft training and certification solutions (Microsoft E-Reference Libraries and Microsoft Certification Program exam vouchers) by using access codes. Access codes put the choice of learning in the hands of your employees. As an administrator, you will receive your access codes electronically at the start of your Volume Licensing agreement term. You can activate the codes at any time during the agreement term.

**Note** If you acquire your access codes during an existing agreement, the cost and benefits are pro-rated, based on the time left on the agreement.

* **Microsoft E-Reference Library code**. To access the library, you must have a license. After the library has been unlocked, you will have access until the end of your Volume Licensing agreement.
* **Microsoft Certification Program exam voucher codes**. You can register to take one exam for each Microsoft Certification Program exam voucher code. Exam voucher codes can only be used once.

**Q: If I do not use all the codes acquired during my agreement, or if an employee resigns, can I reassign the code to another employee or receive a refund for the unused codes?**

No. Access codes for Volume Licensing Online Services (including Microsoft training and certification solutions) are assigned to individuals and are non-transferable. You will not receive a refund. All unused codes expire at the end of the agreement.

**Q: After I place an order, how long does it take to receive exam voucher codes?**

The order will be acknowledged within 48 hours of being processed by Microsoft. You will receive access codes within 5 to 10 business days after the Large Account Reseller order is invoiced by Microsoft.

**Q: May I print, copy, or share Microsoft E-Reference Library books?**

No. Printing, copying, and sharing of Microsoft E-Reference Library materials is prohibited.

### **Volume Licensing**

**Q: How do I obtain Microsoft training and certification solutions packages?**

Microsoft training and certification solutions are available to enterprise and select customers through Microsoft Volume Licensing Online Services. Each package is offered as a Service Subscription License (SSL) without the need for a User Subscription License (USL) or an Add-on Subscription License (ASL). [Contact our sales specialists for pricing information](mailto:mslvlhlp@microsoft.com).

**Q: What is the difference between the pricing and subscription model of Microsoft training and certification solutions and other Volume Licensing Online Services?**

Microsoft training and certification solutions offers one-tier, single-package pricing. Microsoft training and certification solutions packages can be ordered as a 12-month subscription or are pro-rated based on the number of months that are left in the master agreement. There is no need for a separate User Subscription License (USL) or an Add-on Subscription License (ASL), which are required for other programs under Volume Licensing Online Services.

**Note** If you order Microsoft training and certification solutions as a 12-month subscription, subsequent orders will expire at the same time as the initial 12-month subscription order. [Visit the Online Services Guide](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/_silverlight/bac/bac.htm).

**Q: How many codes should I acquire?**

The more codes your organization acquires, the greater the volume discount you receive. We recommend that you use one of the following resources to determine your organization's training needs and to develop a learning plan that aligns with your company's business goals.

- [Send an email message to Microsoft training and certification solutions Volume Licensing Help](mailto:mslvlhlp@microsoft.com)
- [Find your local Microsoft Certified Partner for Microsoft training and certification solutions](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/find-partner.aspx)

**Q: How many exam vouchers should I order?**

To determine how many vouchers you need, first determine:

- The number of people in your organization who need to be certified.
- Which certifications each person needs.
- The number of exams required for each certification.
- The amount of time each person requires to achieve certification.
- The number of months remaining on your license agreement.

Remember that it is important for your people to gain hands-on experience with Microsoft products. We recommend six months or more of preparation for basic certifications and one year for advanced certifications.

### **Microsoft Certification exam packs for academic institutions**

**Q: Which curriculum options are available to prepare for the exams included in the Microsoft Certified Professional (MCP) Class Pack, Microsoft Office Specialist (MOS) Site Pack, and Microsoft Technology Associate (MTA) Site Pack?**

Each exam has preparation materials available. Choose the exam from the [new exams list](/learn/certifications/browse/?resource_type=examination), and then look for the exam’s available preparation options.

**Q: How is the MCP Class Pack fulfilled?**

After the order is placed with the channel partner and processed by Microsoft, a list of exam vouchers is delivered via email to the Notices and Online Contact listed on your Volume Licensing agreement/enrollment and referenced in the order.

**Q: What are the requirements to deploy a MOS or MTA Site License?**

Your institution must be a registered Certiport authorized testing center and comply with the technical requirements posted on the [Certiport website](https://www.certiport.com/Portal/desktopdefault.aspx?page=common/pagelibrary/techRequirements.htm) to utilize the MOS or MTA Site Pack benefit and to deliver MOS or MTA exams. If your institution is not a Certiport authorized testing center, it needs to go through the process to [become a Certiport testing center](https://www.certiport.com/PORTAL/desktopdefault.aspx?tabid=682&roleid=101).

**Q: After I order a MOS or MTA Site Pack through Volume Licensing, how will I be notified of access to the exam vouchers?**
