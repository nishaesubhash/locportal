# Become Microsoft certified and build your resilience for today’s and tomorrow’s digital economy

Grow your options for a career in IT by increasing credibility with a Microsoft Certification, validating your skills and ability to perform in a role using Microsoft technologies.

Testing candidates will have the ability to schedule an exam **before December 31, 2020 and will have until March 31, 2021** to appear for and complete the exam.

With industry-recognized certifications, you’ll have the opportunity to update your LinkedIn profile and increase opportunities to attract recruiters and potential employers for job opportunities. Certifications are a powerful asset for job seekers and those looking to advance in their career. In fact, certifications help make hiring easier, helping job seekers stand out. Over half of IT decision-makers believed the main benefit of certified individuals is their ability to close organizational skills gaps seen in an everchanging technology environment.

## Exam scheduling checklist

To help you prepare and ensure you’re able to register and take your Microsoft Certification exam, please follow the steps below. **Note:** Eligible participants must schedule the discounted exam before December 31, 2020.

1. Review the following key Microsoft Certification resources:
	1. [About online exams with PSI](/learn/certifications/online-exams-psi) – includes participating countries, system requirements, testing protocol requirements, online exam process, and more.  
	2. [Run a system check](https://syscheck.bridge.psiexams.com/) on the same computer and in the same location you will test from.
2. Make sure you have a Microsoft account
	1. If you already have a Microsoft Certification or have taken a Microsoft Certification exam, use the same Microsoft account.  
	2. If you need a Microsoft account, [create one](https://account.microsoft.com/account/manage-my-account).
3. If you do not have a Microsoft Certification profile, you will be prompted to create one when you schedule your exam. <br/>**Important:** When creating your certification profile, make sure your name matches exactly with the government-issued identification you will be using when you take your exam. The proctor will compare the name on your ID with the name in your certification profile as one part of the identify verification process. Learn more about [identify verification requirements](/learn/certifications/online-exams-psi#identity-verification-requirements).
