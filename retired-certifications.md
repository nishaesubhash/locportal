## Retired certifications

Find certifications that have been retired within the last year. When a certification has been retired for more than one year, it will be removed from this page. Once a certification has been retired, it will no longer be able to be attained, but, if it has already earned, it will remain on transcripts in the Active section.

NOTE: After a certification retires, Microsoft continues to review the corresponding technologies to determine whether they are still relevant. If the corresponding technology is determined to no longer be relevant, the associated certifications are moved to the Certification History section of the transcript.
