## Courseware and MOC On-Demand Retirement Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
 
**Q: Why are courses retired?**
  
Microsoft continuously monitors industry trends and revises certification requirements to keep pace with changes in technology. To ensure that we offer you the most relevant training opportunities, we regularly introduce new courses and revise or discontinue older courses. 

**Q: What criteria are used to determine that a course should be retired?**
 
Typically, a course will be retired in one of the following scenarios:

- The course has been replaced. A new course is released which replaces one or more previous courses and which covers the material in a substantially new manner.
- If the technology covered in a course is no longer supported by Microsoft, the courseware will typically be retired.
- Business decisions related to the success of a course or the costs of keeping a course up to date may lead to retirement.
- The certification is retired. If the course was designed for a certification that is no longer offered, the courseware may be retired.
- Courses that are offered by non-Microsoft authors through the community-authoring program may be retired for any reason, at the author’s request.
- Quality concerns may result in course retirement. If quality concerns are identified with a course, it may be retired until the quality can be improved.
  
**Q: How will I know if a course is retired?**
  
Microsoft publishes a quarterly list of courses that are retired and those that are scheduled for retirement within the next three to six months. Retirement announcements are shared through communications with training partners, trainers, vendors, and other interested audiences. The course descriptions on the Microsoft Training Catalog and the Courseware Library Catalog are updated with an announcement of the retirement date.

**Q: How can I purchase a course after its retirement date?**

After their retirement date, courses are no longer sold. The retirement date is published through the catalog webpage for each course and through regular communication channels for each audience. On the effective retirement date, the courseware is marked as no longer for sale. To avoid confusion, the course remains listed as not for sale for a period of time after the effective retirement, until it is archived and removed from the catalog entirely.

**Q: Can I purchase the digital version of a course before retirement and download or use it after the retirement date?**

After the course is retired, you no longer have access to download it. If you downloaded or received the courseware prior to the retirement date, you may use it according to the licensing terms.

**Q: What happens to retired courses that were assigned to me, prior to their retirement, in my Learning Plan and/or added under the “My Courses” section?**

You will continue to see these courses in the “My Courses” section after their retirement, but attempting to launch a retired course will result in an error message.

**Q: If I didn’t complete a course before its retirement, will I be allowed to complete it after it has been retired?**

No. After a course is retired, you can no longer access it.
  
**Q: How will course activity reports reflect in-progress courses at the time of their retirement?**

The course activity reports reflect your progress on a course at the time of its retirement. For example, if a course is at 60% completion by a user when the course is retired, the course activity reports will show 60% completion progress. The completion percentage of a course cannot be changed after a course is retired.

**Q: Will I still be able to find a retired course on the online learning site?**

No. Retired courses no longer appear in search results or in the course catalog.

**Q: When a course retires, will the associated MOC On-Demand (MOD) retire also?**

Yes. Because the MOD aligns with courseware, when a course retires, the MOD will retire on the same date.
