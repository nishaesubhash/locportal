# ACE college credit for certification exams

## Certification for students

Founded in 1918, American Council on Education (ACE) is the only major higher education association to represent all types of United State (U.S.) accredited, degree-granting institutions, including two-year and four-year, public and private. Their members educate two out of every three students in all accredited, degree-granting U.S. institutions.
 
Microsoft asked ACE to review specific certification exams for recommendation for college credit.  Reviews were conducted by subject-matter expert college and university faculty, each of whom taught in related academic areas. The review team analyzed materials, validated learning outcomes and competencies, and recommended post-secondary credit based on its findings.

After successfully earning specific certifications, learners can apply for credit hours through their ACE member school. To find ACE member schools that review Microsoft certifications for college credits, view the [ACE Credit College & University Partnerships page](https://www2.acenet.edu/crm/cup/).

**How to send an official third-party certification transcript to your college/university**

If you want to send an official transcript to the registrar at a college or university, the process for ordering one is as follows:

1. [Log in](https://www.youracclaim.com/) to your account on Credly’s Acclaim platform.
2. Access your account menu in the upper right of the screen and select “Send Transcript”.
3. Enter information carefully, as this is an official document. To order a transcript, you will need:
   - Your full legal name and date of birth so the institution can identify you in their system.
   - The name and/or department and email address for the recipient of the transcript. Look on the college’s website for information about where to send transfer transcripts, as it varies with each institution.
5. When everything is entered, click “Continue”.
6. Before you order, click on “View Transcript” to download a free copy. We recommend you use this copy of the transcript to check that all of your credentials are displayed correctly before you send an official version. If a credential is missing on your transcript but it shows up on your profile, check to make sure that the credential is set to “Public” so that it can be included. 
7. Click “Send” and look for the pop up to let you know it’s been delivered.

For more details view [Credly's Transcript Feature video](https://support.youracclaim.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042534771-Video-Credly-s-Transcript-Feature).

NOTE: You can also keep the downloaded copy for your records. However, do not send a copy of your transcript to a college yourself. Most institutions will consider a transcript sent by a student as unofficial and will not accept it.


**How to claim your Microsoft Badge**

Claiming your Microsoft badge is simple. After you’ve earned a certification or passed an exam, you will receive a notification email from Microsoft. To claim your first badge:
1. Click the link in the email you received.
2. Create an account on Credly’s Acclaim platform.
3. Confirm your account by clicking the link in a confirmation email that is generated after you set up your account.

**Getting help**

The [Acclaim Help Center](https://support.youracclaim.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) has many guides for how to use your digital credentials, but if you can’t find the answers to a technical question, you can submit a [help request](https://support.youracclaim.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

If you have competed a course or exam but have not received an invitation email to accept a badge, do the following:

If you already have a transcript from ACE’s CREDIT service with courses from other providers, you may need to contact the [ACE Student Resource Center](https://www.acenet.edu/Programs-Services/Pages/Credit-Transcripts/Student-Resource-Center.aspx) to get your new accomplishments added to your transcript. As we move all of our educational partners to Credly’s Acclaim platform, we will phase out the old transcript portal you previously used. Keep an eye out for information from CREDIT about moving your credentials to Credly.

The [ACE Student Resource Center](https://www.acenet.edu/Programs-Services/Pages/Credit-Transcripts/Student-Resource-Center.aspx) can also help if you are having trouble communicating with an institution or if they have questions about the transcript you sent. You can email the resource center at credit@acenet.edu or call Monday through Friday from 8:45 a.m. to 4:45 p.m Pacific.
