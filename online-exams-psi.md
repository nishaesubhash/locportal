# About online exams with PSI

Fundamentals and role-based certification exams that are a part of the [USD15 exam offer for job seekers](https://aka.ms/skillscert) must be taken online through PSI, Microsoft’s exam delivery partner for this offer. Taking an exam online provides a completely digital experience in the comfort of your home or office while maintaining the integrity of exam results by being monitored by a proctor via webcam and microphone. To understand what the experience is like, [watch PSI’s YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvqONzwF2nM) and learn more about taking proctored online exams with PSI.

## <a name="participating-countries-and-supported-languages"></a> Participating countries and supported languages

Online exams with PSI are available in most countries and may be available in different languages: English, Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese, French, Spanish, and German.

## <a name="testing-protocol-requirements"></a> Testing protocol requirements

To maintain the integrity of proctored exams in an online setting, specific policies, practices, and procedures are enforced.

### Office or home setting:

Your office or home setting must meet the following requirements:

- Office or conference room must be walled, have a closed door, and be free from disruptions.
- If taking the exam at your home, the room should be free from disruptions.
- No one else can be in or enter the room during your testing session.

### Communicating with the greeter and proctor:

- **Phone.** During the check-in process, you will be prompted to enter your phone number.  If a technical issue arises, technical support will call you on the phone number provided.
- **Chat window.** All communication with the greeter and proctor occurs via the chat window.
- **Language.** All communication with the greeter and proctor is conducted in English only.

### <a name="identity-verification-requirements"></a> Identity verification requirements:

- You are required to present a current government-issued form of ID, such as one of the following:
  - Driver's license
  - Passport
  - Identification card (national/state/province identity card)
  - Alien registration card (green card, permanent resident, visa)
  - Government-issued local language ID (not in Roman characters)—_accepted only if issued from the country in which the candidate is testing_
- A webcam photo will be taken of you and your photo ID.
- The name on the ID must exactly match the name in your Microsoft Certification and PSI profiles.
- If you are in the process of updating or renewing your identification, please note that legal name change forms, including ID renewal forms, cannot be accepted for online exams.

### Work area scan:

- With your webcam, phone or laptop, you will be asked to scan slowly, left to right, to show surrounding walls and to scan up and down to show the floor and ceiling. If you are unable to complete a work area scan, you are not permitted to proceed further or to take the exam.
- You will then scan your entire work area. The proctor is looking for security risks, including but not limited to:
  - Additional monitors (must be unplugged and turned away from you)
  - Additional computers (must be turned off and monitors must be dark)
- The work area should be clear of all materials, including the following items that are not allowed within arm's reach: books, notepads, Post-it notes, typed notes/papers, or writing instruments such as pens, markers, whiteboards, or pencils.

### No personal belongings:

- During the exam, you may not access the following types of personal items: hand-held computers or other electronic devices, pagers, watches, wallets, purses, hats (or other head coverings), bags, coats, books, notes, or any other materials not specifically approved.
- In the event of a support issue, technical support may try to contact you on your mobile phone at the number you provide during exam check-in. Please ensure your mobile phone number includes the country code. It is acceptable to keep the cell phone nearby but not in arm's reach.
- You may be asked to turn out all your pockets (pockets of pants and blazer/sweater) so the greeter can see that they are empty.
- If you are wearing long sleeves, you may be asked to roll up your sleeves to show that there is no writing on your arm(s).
- If you are wearing a tie, you may be asked to lift the tie to show the greeter that nothing is hidden under the tie.
- If you have long hair that covers your ears, you may be asked to pull your hair back to show the greeter that there is nothing attached to your ear (such as a Bluetooth earpiece).

### No breaks, eating, or drinking:

- Breaks are not allowed during the exam for any reason. You understand and agree that, if you take a break, your exam score will be invalidated, and you will not be allowed to resume the exam later.
- Eating, drinking, smoking, and chewing gum are prohibited during the exam.

### No exam assistance:

- **No one can enter the room during your testing session. If this occurs, your exam will be terminated.**
- You may not receive assistance or coaching from other individuals while taking the exam, and you may not allow other individuals to see the computer screen during the exam.
- You are not allowed to use books or other resources, scratch paper, erasable whiteboards, or any other writing object during the exam. You are also not permitted to use any writing instruments, such as a pen, marker, or pencil, during exam delivery.
- The proctor cannot answer questions related to exam content. If you have questions related to exam content, please contact Microsoft after you complete the exam.

### Facial comparison policy:

- By registering for an online exam delivery, you understand and agree that PSI may use facial comparison technology for the purpose of verifying your identity during the testing process. It will compare your facial image to the one on your identification and to facial images captured during the testing process to help us further develop, upgrade, and improve this application. **If you do not agree to this, you will not be able to test.**

### Recording during the exam:

- When taking this exam, the proctor will continuously monitor you by video and audio. The entire session will be recorded. Monitoring will include your face (eye movements, head movements, etc.), voice, the physical room where you are seated, and the location during exam. If you do not wish to be recorded (either by video or audio), please notify the proctor immediately but note you will NOT be able to proceed with the exam.

### Other important information:

- As with any other Microsoft Certification exam, you must read and agree to the terms stated in our [non-disclosure agreement](/learn/certifications/certification-exam-policies#non-disclosure-agreement) and must comply with the candidate conduct requirements. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:
  - You may not copy or record questions or answers from the exam using any means. 
  - You may not share or discuss the questions or answers seen in the exam with others.
- If you do not follow the [non-disclosure agreement](/learn/certifications/certification-exam-policies#non-disclosure-agreement) or are suspected of cheating or tampering with software from PSI or its subcontractor, or if someone other than you is detected in the room where you are seated during the exam, the proctor will immediately terminate the exam and report the infraction to PSI and Microsoft, along with audio and/or video evidence. Your exam may be invalidated, and Microsoft may take other action, such as decertifying you and precluding all future participation in the Microsoft Certification program.

## <a name="run-a-system-check"></a> Run a System Check

Prior to registering for and purchasing your exam, [complete the required system check](https://syscheck.bridge.psiexams.com/) on the same computer and in the same location you will test from.

## <a name="frequently-asked-questions"></a> Frequently asked questions

Find answers to frequently asked questions about online proctored exams delivered by PSI.

### How do I know if an online exam is right for me?
Start by ensuring online exams are available to you based on [participating countries and supported languages](/learn/certifications/online-exams-psi#participating-countries-and-supported-languages), that you meet [system requirements](/learn/certifications/online-exams-psi#system-requirements) and [testing protocol requirements](/learn/certifications/online-exams-psi#testing-protocol-requirements). You may also want to [complete a system check](https://syscheck.bridge.psiexams.com/) to ensure your computer meets requirements.

### Can I still take my exam online if my system does not pass the system test?
No, you should not register for an online exam with PSI if your system does not pass the system test.

### How do I request for exam accommodations?
To request for exam accommodations, please [submit an accommodations request with PSI](https://psi-cdexp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000150872) prior to scheduling an exam. PSI will respond to the request within 24-48 business hours.

### How do I schedule for an online exam with PSI?
See the "**[Register for an online exam](/learn/certifications/online-exams-psi#schedule-for-an-online-exam)**" section on this page.

### Can I reschedule or cancel my exam?
Yes, but you must do so at least 24 hours prior to your exam appointment.

You will then be redirected to the PSI site to cancel or reschedule your exam.  

Note: The USD15 job seeker exam offer must be claimed by December 31, 2020 and the exam must be taken by March 31, 2021.

However, you can retake a certification exam at the standard price by going to the select certification exam page, and clicking the ”Schedule with Pearson VUE” button.  

### It seems like it would be much easier to cheat if I'm not at a test center. Are online exams secure?
We're committed to protecting the integrity of our certification exams, regardless of how they are delivered. When you take an exam online, you must first install a secure browser that enforces rigorous safeguards throughout the testing process, and you must meet [system requirements](/learn/certifications/online-exams-psi#system-requirements) and [testing protocol requirements](/learn/certifications/online-exams-psi#testing-protocol-requirements).

### Are online exams more difficult than exams taken at test centers?
No. The exams are equivalent in terms of difficulty.

### May I take notes during my online exam?
No. This feature is not available with PSI’s online exam delivery. See [testing protocol requirements](/learn/certifications/online-exams-psi#testing-protocol-requirements).

### Are online exams available in multiple languages?
Yes. The online exams with PSI are available in the following languages: English, Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese, French, Spanish, and German. The ability to select exam language will be made available during the exam registration process. Note that proctor support and the proctoring software is available in English only.

### If I have technical issues before, during, or after the online exam, who do I contact?
For scheduling questions, please use the PSI ’Contact Us’ links provided during registration. If you encounter a technical issue during exam delivery, the exam proctor will help you try to resolve the issue. If necessary, the proctor will connect you directly with PSI support via chat.

For support before or after the online exam, [contact PSI support](https://psi-cdexp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360001044112).

Please review the [identity verification requirements](/learn/certifications/online-exams-psi#identity-verification-requirements) section.

### How do I change my legal name?
Your name must exactly match the government issued identification you provide during the check-in process. If you need to update the name in your Microsoft Certification profile, please see our [Certification Help](https://aka.ms/certhelp) page.

### Where can I find a list of exam policies?
Please refer to the [exam policies and FAQs](/learn/certifications/certification-exam-policies) that apply to all Microsoft Certification exams.

## Remote proctoring troubleshooting FAQs

### What do I do if I experience issues sharing my web camera?
- Check for any 3rd party camera applications running in the background and close them.
- Ensure that applications are allowed access to the web camera by checking your privacy settings.
- Allow Win32WebViewHost in camera privacy settings.

### How do I return to the exam if the browser suddenly closes or I accidentally close the browser or am kicked out of the exam?
Relaunch the PSI Secure Browser to return to the exam.

### What do I do if I cannot pass the Compatibility Check for System Requirements?
Close any applications identified by the PSI Secure Browser that are running.

### What do I do if I am unable to access the exam or the exam link is not appearing?
Log out of your Microsoft Certification dashboard and reinitiate the sign in process using a chromium-based browser. Click on the **launch exam** button. *Note that the button will be active no earlier than 15 minutes prior to your scheduled appointment time.*

### What do I do if a proctor has not joined my session?
Right click anywhere in the PSI Secure Browser page and select “reload” or select from the top left corner “View” and then “Reload.” If that doesn’t work, close the PSI Secure Browser and relaunch. Note that you will **not** be able to log in or launch your exam earlier than 15 minutes prior to your scheduled appointment time.

## Score Report FAQs

### How and when will I get my exam results?
You will receive notification of your pass or fail status within a few minutes of completing your exam. In addition, you will receive an email from PSI that provides your exam score and feedback on your performance on the skill areas measured. The exam delivery provider will forward your score to Microsoft within 24 hours.

### What does the score report look like?
The score report is an email that provides a numeric score for overall exam performance, pass/fail status, information on your performance in each skill area assessed on the exam, and details on how to interpret your results and next steps. 

### What do the percentages on the score report mean?
The percentages show your performance on each section, or skill area, assessed on the exam. These percentages provide information regarding your section-level performance. Higher percentages reflect stronger performance.

Because each section may contain a different number of questions, as represented by the percentages provided after the section name, the percentages that you obtained cannot be combined to determine the percent of questions that you answered correctly on the exam. This information is intended to help you understand areas of strength and weakness in the skill domain measured by the exam and to prioritize those skills that need improvement.

### What is included in the “unscored survey items” bar?
Please ignore the “Unscored Survey Items” bar if it appears in the exam section results above. It is not included in your exam score and does not provide any information about your performance on this exam or your skills in this content domain. It is an artifact of the PSI reporting system that cannot be suppressed at this time.

### Can I see a lower level of detail on my performance?
No, we do not provide a lower level of detail on your performance than what is provided in the score report.

### The percentages on the score report show that I have scored more than 70 percent. Why didn’t I pass the exam?
Each section of the exam contains a different number of questions; therefore, combining the results across individual exam sections will not reflect your final exam result. In other words, there is no one-to-one relationship between percentages reported for each section and your pass/fail status.

Further, a common misperception is that you must answer 70 percent of the questions correctly to pass the exam because the passing score is 700; however, this is a scaled score. The actual percentage of questions that you must answer correctly varies from exam to exam and may be more or less than 70 percent, depending on the input provided by the subject-matter experts who helped us set the cut score during exam development and ongoing sustainment and the difficulty of the questions delivered when you take exam.

### Where can I find additional information about my areas of weakness?
Although Microsoft Certification exams provide feedback about the areas where examinees need to develop their skills further, the exams are not designed to provide detailed or diagnostic feedback. We encourage you to review the “Skills measured” section of the exam details page on [Microsoft Learn](https://microsoft.com/learn?WT.mc_id=gsi), leverage learning resources at the bottom of the exam page, and honestly evaluate your skills against what is being assessed on the exam. The best way to do this is to actually perform the tasks listed; note any challenges that you encountered. Practice until you no longer experience those challenges. 

You may also want to ask others how they perform those tasks. Do they perform the task differently? Understand why they do. Read white papers, visit [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com?WT.mc_id=gsi) and [Microsoft Learn](https://microsoft.com/learn?WT.mc_id=gsi) to get additional information about the tasks that are included on the exam. 

Finally, [Microsoft Official Practice Tests](http://www.measureup.com/Microsoft-Practice-Tests-C318.aspx) are available for some of our certification exams. These may provide more information about your specific strengths and weaknesses. However, passing a practice test is not a guarantee that you will pass the certification exam.

### I no longer have my score report email. How can I request another one?
[Contact PSI support](https://psi-cdexp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360001044112).
