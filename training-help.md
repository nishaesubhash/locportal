# Support: Learning Partner course scheduling on Learn

## Instructor-led training

Microsoft is releasing a simplified and streamlined learner experience by bringing real time instructor-led training scheduling capabilities to [Microsoft Learn](/learn/). The course schedule integration on Microsoft Learn will enable learners to preview instructor-led training courses offered by qualified Learning Partners. Once a course is selected you will be routed directly to the Learning Partner site to complete registration and payment.  

Please see below for answers to common questions and a channel for providing feedback and support. While you will not receive a response to feedback during ‘Public Preview’, please know your feedback is important and will be addressed.   

Course registration will be available in English only to start. Additional qualifying Learning Partners will be added over the next year.
